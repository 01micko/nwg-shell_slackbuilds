This repo contains SlackBuilds (tested on -current) for nwg-shell - https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell

This is currently IN DEVELOPMENT and I consider it to be ALPHA stage and may very well be broken
or not work at all.

The first package you need to build/install is google-go-lang and you should have python3 already,
one or two of the nwg packages dep on another, but I haven't done a clean build yet to know for
sure which ones dep on which ones.

Some of these scripts (mostly python deps) have been edited from their packages on SBo, if you 
have any of them installed, they should work as-is, but I cannot make any guarantees. My advice 
is to build/install fresh packages.

This is technically not released in any semi-professional manner, and as such, any edits done to 
SlackBuilds will not recieve BUILD flag updates until I see that it's fit for public release. 
At which point, I will offer binary package downloads from a repo for stable (15.0) and possibly 
-current as well, which I'll setup when I feel nwg-shell is ready.

Do NOT ask for packages as of now please, if you're interested and willing to test, please build
it and report any errors (if any). The Go code is not optimized, as the flags fail for me locally, 
which is why they are commented out.
