xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland (XDG backend for hyprland)

Due to reasons explained in hyprland-protocols, we have a separate
desktop portal impl for Hyprland. Although -wlr does work with
Hyprland, -hyprland offers more features.

This relies on 'qt6' and 'qt6-wayland' (NOT currently packaged) for
screensharing to work. Please be advised unless you have qt6 installed
there may be missing features in Hyprland as a result.

I am not currently packaging qt6 yet, I must research and test it
before I'll bother shipping the feature, for now we'll ship without it
and I'll consider it for the future.
