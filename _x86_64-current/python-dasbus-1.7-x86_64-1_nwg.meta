python-dasbus:
python-dasbus: Dasbus is a DBus library written in Python 3, based on GLib and
python-dasbus: inspired by pydbus. The code used to be part of the Anaconda
python-dasbus: Installer project. It was based on the pydbus library, but we
python-dasbus: replaced it with our own solution because its upstream development
python-dasbus: stalled. The dasbus library is a result of this effort.
