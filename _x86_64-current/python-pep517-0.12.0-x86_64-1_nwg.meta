PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
python-pep517: python-pep517 (API to call PEP 517 hooks)
python-pep517:
python-pep517: This package contains wrappers around the hooks specified by PEP 517
python-pep517: and PEP 660. It provides:
python-pep517:
python-pep517: - A mechanism to call the hooks in a subprocess, so they are isolated
python-pep517:   from the current process.
python-pep517: - Fallbacks for the optional hooks, so that frontends can call
python-pep517:   the hooks without checking which are defined.
