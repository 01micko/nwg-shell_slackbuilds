PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
python-xlib: python-xlib (X Library module for Python)
python-xlib:
python-xlib: The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client
python-xlib: library for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in
python-xlib: contrast to earlier X libraries for Python which were interfaces to
python-xlib: the C Xlib. The communication takes place over TCP/IP, Unix sockets,
python-xlib: DECnet or any other streaming network protocol. The C Xlib is merely
python-xlib: an interface to this protocol, providing functions suitable for a C
python-xlib: environment.
